<p>On May 30, 1943, Duke Ellington and his orchestra were broadcast on the <A href=http://www.otrcat.com/fitch-bandwagon-p-48800.html target=blank>"Fitch Bandwagon"</A> Sunday evening NBC Red Network radio show sponsored by F.W. Fitch Co. for its Fitch Shampoo and related personal care products. Ellington's episode included announcements, music by Ellington's orchestra, and an interview of Duke interspersed between musical selections.</p>

<p>
At the time, Ellington and his orchestra were playing an extended engagement at the Hurricane Restaurant in New York. <a title="Dr. Klaus Stratemann, Duke Ellington, Day by Day and Film by Film, p.242">Stratemann</a> says this broadcast was one of the few times the full Ellington band appeared outside the Hurricane during the residency, but others believe Ellington's broadcast was not live, but rather, the broadcast of a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_disc target=_blank>transcription disc</a> using previously recorded material. </p>

<p>This webpage begins by <a href="FITCHBANDWAGONNetworkRadioShow.html#summary">summarizing the reports and discussions</a>, followed by NBC's <a href="FITCHBANDWAGONNetworkRadioShow.html#19430530">script for the Ellington broadcast, </a>, and finally, <a href="FITCHBANDWAGONNetworkRadioShow.html#Series">a complete list of Fitch Bandwagon programs by year</a>.
<br><br>The NBC records were provided by record producer <b>Carl A. H&auml;llstr&ouml;m</b> from his research of the network's files now located at the Library of Congress.</p>

<p>It seems most likely this broadcast was broadcast live but the original recording of the program is lost.  AFRS mixed the music from this broadcast with other Ellington recordings to produce an AFRS transcription, without commercials but with a message for the Armed Forces, for later broadcast.  The AFRS transcription has survived, and it is the source of disagreement. </p>

<p>This view is supported by Dennis Spragg of the Glenn Miller Archive:*
<div style="margin-left:50px; padding-left: 5px; border-left: 1px dashed blue;max-width:600px;"><!--
<div style="margin: 0 10px 0 30px; padding-left: 5px; border-left: 1px dashed blue;"-->'... Please allow me to add one very important detail:<br><br> NBC strict policy as of this time (1943) was to NOT ALLOW broadcasts of recorded or assembled recorded commercial programs. CBS had the same policy. Hence, you'll remember that bands like Glenn Miller and Tommy Dorsey had to broadcast early and late commercial programs to satisfy the policy. Of course, the experience of the war years and advances in technology made recording a natural and normal practice following the war. You'll remember that Bing Crosby was adamant about being able to record his "Kraft Music Hall" programs on NBC during 1945 and this led to his departure from the series and the network for Philco and ABC, who were more than pleased to allow "Der Bingle" to record his programs, in 1946<br><br>So as much as NBC was involved in recording content for the OWI, AFRS, et. al., and made discs of their own programs for compliance purposes and time-zones, etc., <b>it is highly unlikely that the "Fitch Bandwagon" broadcast of May 30, 1943 with Duke Ellington was anything other than a live broadcast</b>. The script is not a guide for engineers but the actual working script to verify for the sponsor that their paid-for program ran appropriately and with proper verbiage selling the hair tonic.<br><br>From that point, SSD (this was not AFRS until November 1943) did their normal "surgery" to remove commercial content and insert items from elsewhere. That I cannot speak to. But it is clear to me that <b>the original NBC broadcast would have been live under any circumstance</b>.'</div> <div style="margin-left:100px; padding-left: 5px; font-size:.7em;">* Email, D.

<a name=summary></a> <h3>Summary of Reports and Discussion</h3>

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>To follow the technical discussion about Ellington's <i>Fitch Bandwagon</i> broadcast, it helps to have a little background:</p>

<ul><li>Fitch Bandwagon was a Sunday evening network radio show from 1938 to 1946. Each week, famous American dance orchestras were featured, a different one each week, and incidents from the bandleader's life were dramatized.  In Ellington's case, this appears to be by means of a four-part scripted interview interspersed with music.  The show opened and closed with the show's theme song, performed by an unnamed orchestra, which may have been prerecorded.</li>
<li>The Radio Section, Information and Orientation Branch, Morale Services Division of the United States Army became the Special Services Division (SSD) in July 1942 and in November 1943 became the United States Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS). <a href=http://www.colorado.edu/amrc/glenn-miller/gma-studies/armed-forces-radio-service target=_blank>(Source: Glenn Miller Archive)</a>. Many transcriptions were dubbed from recorded radio broadcasts, and the technicians were expert at mixing such materials to produce new programs that appeared to be live.</li><li>SSD and AFRS created long-playing Electric Transcription records which simulated radio shows and were shipped to foreign locations to be broadcast or played to U.S. military personnel.</li><li>Record collectors possess audio tapes of Ellington's Fitch Bandwagon show that are not identical, leading some to suggest the music was previously recorded rather than being broadcast live.</li>
</ul>


<h4>The issue</h4>

<p>Did Ellington and his orchestra play the Fitch Bandwagon broadcast live, or was the broadcast done with prerecorded material?</p>

<p>
The late <b>Ole J. Nielsen</b>'s discography, <i>Jazz Records 1942-80, A discography: Vol. Six, Duke Ellington</i>, p. 10 says</p><blockquote><q>This was a rebroadcast.  The numbers probably came from an earlier broadcast.</q></blockquote>

<p>
At page 8 of the International Duke Ellington Music Society <a href=http://depanorama.net/dems/1999-3.pdf target=_blank><i>DEMS bulletin 1999/1</i></a>, collector and record re-issuer <b>Jerry Valburn</b> wrote</p><blockquote><q>...Nielsen claims that the numbers on this program come from an earlier broadcast. This is not true. I was at the actual broadcast The numbers performed here are: Perdido/Duke Interview / Hayfoot, Strawfoot / Don't Get Around Much Anymore / Duke Interview / A Slip Of The Lip / Ring Dem Bells / Just As Though You Were Here / Things Ain't What They Used To Be.<br><br>My own source material comes from both an AFRS 16 inch transcription called FITCH BANDWAGON No 31 (series later changed to just BANDWAGON) and some glass base acetates in my collection.(all this material is now at the Library of Congress)...</q></blockquote>

<p>On page 20 of <a href=http://depanorama.net/dems/1999-3.pdf target=_blank><i>DEMS bulletin 99/3</i></a>, the late <b>Sjef Hoefsmit</b> discussed the recordings in the Fitch Bandwagon broadcast that were included in <a title="From 1942 to 1949 and in 1952 and 1953, the United States War Department Special Service Division (SSD) and its successor, the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS) produced 437 Jubilee programs.  These were 16-inch electrical program transcriptions (long-playing records) used in weekly broadcasts to American military personnel around the world.  The American Music Research Center Glenn Miller Archive (GMA) at the University of Colorado, Boulder, maintains an AFRS Jubilee catalogue describing each program and record.">AFRS Jubilee transcription</a> show number 69, assembled or dubbed in May 1944.  <br><br>The Jubilee show included <i>Canteen Bounce</i> and <i>Hayfoot, Strawfoot</i> from the May 1943 <i>Fitch Bandwagon</i> and other music recorded November 8, 9 and 27, 1943.  (The <a href=http://www.colorado.edu/amrc/node/594/attachment target=_blank>GMA catalogue</a> lists the contents of Jubilee program 69.)</p>

<p>Herr Hoefsmit went on to discuss the Fitch Bandwagon recording of <i>Just As Though You Were Here</i>, saying it is identical to the <A title="the same as the AFRS # 212 and the Coca Cola 'Spotlight Bands # 51' broadcasts"> November 19, 1942 NBC Blue Network broadcast from Fort Dix</a>. He wrote</p><blockquote><q>If Jerry was present during the recording of <i>Just As Though You Were Here</i> on 30May43, the date of 19Nov42 must also be false.  Is it possible that <i>Just As Though You Were Here</i> was recorded not on 30May43 but earlier, on 19Nov42, together with two other selections not in Jerry's listing but included on my tape with the re-broadcast of the Fitch Bandwagon: a longer version of <i>Perdido</i> and the closing <i>Goin' Up</i>? These two selections have also been compared with the 19Nov42 selections and found to be identical.<br><br>I have read this explanation several times,and I must say that it is hard to understand. Because of this difficulty, here are the four broadcasts in question,...</q></blockquote><p>[He then lists and analyzes Jubilee program #1, Coca Cola Spotlight Bands (Fort Dix), the hypothetical original broadcast tape, and Jubilee program #69. ]</p>

<p>At pages 6 & 7 of <a href=http://tinyurl.com/DEMS99-4  target=_blank>DEMS 99/4</a>, <b>Klaus G&ouml;tting</b> said the Fitch Bandwagon recording of <i>A Slip of the Lip</i>, was identical to a recording made July 26, 1942.  Herr Hoefsmit agreed and went on to discuss the different taped versions of the broadcast held by collectors.</p>

<p> Herr Hoefsmit stated the show included a four part interview with Duke, and described a hypothetical Tape #1, being a full recording of the actual broadcast. <br><br>He suggested Tape #2 was made from Tape #1, focusing on the spoken word rather than the music.  The entire Fitch commercial and the interview segments were on this tape, but the musical selections were truncated.  The tape ends with the introduction to <i>A Slip of the Lip</i>.</p>

<p> Sjef then suggests Tape #3 was dubbed from Tape #2, starting at the end of the Fitch advertisement. From here, the tape is identical to Tape #2 except for the length of the silence between an interrupted <i>Hayfoot, Strawfoot</i> and the beginning of the mutilated <i>Don't Get Around Much Anymore</i>. After the third interview segment, however, this tape used the RCA Victor recording of <i>A Slip of the Lip</i>.</p>

<p>Tape #4 begins with an introduction:</p><blockquote><q>A Special Service <b><u>Re-broadcast</u></b> featuring the most popular dance orchestras in America for all the armed forces in the United Nations. Here comes the Bandwagon..."</q> [emphasis added]</blockquote>

<p>
Herr Hoefsmit speculated that since this was a <b><u>re-</u></b>broadcast, there must have been original broadcast which he calls Tape #1.  He did not have a Tape #1, its existence was hypothetical.</p>

<p>
Next, Herr Hoefsmit quoted a typewritten script dated May 28, 1943 for the May 30 Fitch Bandwagon broadcast provided by Herr H&auml;llstr&ouml;m (reproduced at the end of this webpage).<br><br>Herr Hoefsmit suggests the script indicates an original tape (Tape #1), with his Tape #4 being the rebroadcast.<br><br>Tape #4 begins</p><blockquote><q>A Special Service Re-broadcast featuring the most popular dance orchestras in America for all the armed forces in the United Nations. Here comes the Bandwagon...</q></blockquote>

<p>
He continues:</p><blockquote><q>This tape starts straight after the introduction (see earlier in this article) with <i>Take The "A" Train</i>, followed by interview A and <i>The Canteen Bounce</i>. The Fitch commercial is skipped from this re-broadcast, which continues with the short version of <i>Perdido</i>, followed by the complete interview B (as on tapes # 2 and # 3). But now there comes a complete <i>Hayfoot, Strawfoot</i> followed by an introduction to the next selection by Tobe Reed: the complete <i>Don't Get Around Much Anymore</i>.<br><br>

Interview C is again the same as on tapes # 2 and # 3, but the version of <i>A Slip Of The Lip</i> that follows is completely different from the RCA recording. It corresponds exactly with the description in DESOR for 4319c.<br><br>

This selection is followed immediately, and with no further introduction, by <i>Just As Though You Were Here</i>, taken from the Fort Dix broadcast of 19Nov42....<br><br>

The time gained as a result of the deletion of the Fitch commercials and the News Spot is now occupied by recordings of earlier broadcasts! It is indeed a re-broadcast! <br><br>

After the substituted <i>Just As Though You Were Here</i>, comes (again without any introduction) <i>Things Ain't What They Used To Be</i> followed by interview D and the performance of <i>Ring Dem Bells</i>, all from the original broadcast, conjectured tape # 1. The re-broadcast concludes with two other selections from the Fort Dix broadcast, <i>Perdido</i> and <i>Goin' Up</i>.<br><br>

My tape # 4 ends with the words: "The Bandwagon was brought to you, solders, sailors and marines in the Armed Forces of the United Nations, by the Special Service Division of the War Department of the United States of America."<br><br>

Not once on tape # 4 do I hear the name Fitch.</q></blockquote>

<p style="margin-left:25%; font-style:italic;">Webmaster's comment:<br>At first blush,  it might seem Tape #4 was from a much later rebroadcast since the United Nations was not formed until October 1945.<br><br>On January 1 and 2, 1942, however, 26 countries executed a "declaration of united nations," forming an alliance against the Axis powers.  This pact was called the United Nations in the American press.</p>

<p>
<u><b>The Treasury Shows</b>:</u><br>According to Storyville Records, 48 LPs of the Ellington broadcasts for the U.S. Treasury Department radio shows were issued on a private pressing during <A title="These might be the 48 D.E.T.S. LPs listed in New Desor vol.II, pages 1339 to 1349, released between 1981 and 1989."> the 1960s [<i>sic</i>]</a>. Storyville undertook to release these on CD, and as at the time of writing, has issued 20 two-disc sets.</p>

<p>
D.E.T.S. <a href=http://tinyurl.com/DETS9013-9016 target=_blank>Volume 16</a> includes the Fitch Bandwagon broadcast.  <b>Roger Boyes</b>, author of the D.E.T.S. booklet, wrote the May 30 1943 broadcast is <q>here issued commercially for the first time</q>. The track timings add up to 21 minutes and 23 seconds, but Mr. Boyes says <i>Stratemann</i> and <i>Vail</i> show a 30-minute broadcast.</p>

<p>Mr. Boyes continues</p><blockquote><q>Though designed to give the impression that the Ellington Orchestra was in the studio, to perform between the various stages of a conversation between Duke and an unidentified interviewer, all the music originates in existing recordings available to the broadcaster.  Duke's discographers in <i>New DESOR</i> [sic] mention three, although their information is not wholly accurate.  My hunch is that all the music is from late May airchecks, and that everything was then put together, and transmitted on 30 May.</q></blockquote>

<p>Herr H&auml;llstr&ouml;m:</p><blockquote><q>Jerry [Valburn] could never locate the network version and had to settle for the edited AFRS version which had the ad talks removed and replaced with tunes from other Ellington broadcasts of the period.<br><br>You need to have a script or a recording of the network broadcast in order to be able to understand what has been done to the transcription.</q></blockquote>

<p><u><b>New Desor Correction Sheet 1011</b></u> lists the personnel as:<br>
<u>DUKE ELLINGTON AND HIS ORCHESTRA</u><br>W. Jones, Baker, Jordan, Nance, Brown, Nanton, Tizol, Hamilton, Hodges, Nat Jones, Webster, Carney, Ellington, Guy, Raglin, Greer, Roch&eacute;<br><br>At the time of writing, the <a href=http://depanorama.net/43.htm target=_blank>Duke Ellington Panorama</a> and <a href=http://ellingtonia.com/discography/1941-1950.html target=_blank>Ellingtonia.com</a> on-line discographies list the same personnel.  The personnel list in the D.E.T.S. booklet does not name the singers (Roch&eacute; is not listed with the band personnel at all) but their vocals are heard on the C.D.</p>

<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>The script was written May 28.  It seems likely to have been meant to be used in a live broadcast on May 30.  If so, then it seems clear that Duke Ellington and His Orchestra appeared live on the May 30 Fitch Bandwagon show. <br><br>

A skeptic would suggest the script was just a road map to guide the technicians in assembling the recordings to be dubbed onto a transcription to be aired May 30. This scenario seems unlikely, since the work would have to be done in only two days, leaving no margin of error.

<p>There seems to be little question the Fitch Bandwagon broadcast featuring Duke Ellington and his Orchestra was broadcast live but the original recording of the program is lost.<br><br>

To paraphrase Carl A. H&auml;llstr&ouml;m:</p>
<blockquote><blockquote><q>If you are going to document the SSD/AFRS transcription of Ellington's Fitch Bandwagon, you should be aware that it is edited. All the ads have been removed and  replaced by tracks of the Ellington orchestra from other broadcast series.<br><br>

You need to have a script or a recording of the network broadcast in order to be able to understand what has been done to the transcription.</q></blockquote></blockquote>


<br><br>One way or another, the AFRS transcription is not a true copy of the broadcast.  It was mixed later with recordings from separate sources including the Fitch Bandwagon broadcast, omitting the commercials and adding words addressing armed forces personnel.<br><br>The original recording of the Fitch broadcast is lost, so  all the tapes held by collectors appear to have been made from the AFRS transcription that exists in its original form on an acetate at the Library of Congress, leading to varying reports in the published discographies.th<br><br>

I do not yet know if the DETS CD was dubbed from one or more of those tapes or from the AFRS acetate itself.  It includes audience noise, and that noise doesn't sound genuine to me.

<br><br><b>MUSIC</b> -- FITCH SIGNATURE

<br><br><b>Announcer:</b><br> Here comes the Fitch Bandwagon!

<br><br>Vocal:<br> <blockquote>Laugh a while, let a song be your style.<br>Use Fitch Shampoo.<br>Don't despair, use your head, save your hair.<br>Use Fitch Shampoo.</blockquote><br>

<b>Announcer:</b><br> Another Sunday evening rolls around, and the old Fitch Bandwagon rolls around with it, bringing you its cargo of the famous Fitch's Dandruff Remover Shampoo and Ideal Hair Tonic, the music of one of America's famous orchestras, and the new cargo of World News by Alex Dreier. That's a big cargo to handle, but not too much for our old friend the Driver of the Bandwagon, that Man who Knows His Bands. Tobe Reed.
<br><br>(APPLAUSE)

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br> Ah thank you Jack Costello, and hello everybody. Before we start the old Bandwagon rolling, we'd like to pause a moment and pay humble tribute to the occasion we celebrate on this May 30th. Originally we thought only of the brave men who fought to preserve the Union when we celebrated Decoration Day. However, the day has come to mean more to us than just that. It is a day we pay tribute to all brave men who have fallen in the cause of freedom, equality, and justice for all. Our thoughts turn to our boys in all parts of the world who are serving the same cause their grandfathers and great grandfathers served. freedom for all peoples. (1:30)

<br><br>(APPLAUSE)

<br><br>Well passengers, the Bandwagon gets under way now, and we really have a supply of musical power. We present a man honored in this country and abroad for his contributions to modern music in general, and American music in particular. If more need be said, let his music say it for me.
</s>

<br><br>(APPLAUSE)<br><br>
<u>"A special services rebroadcast featuring the most popular dance orchestras in America for all you men and women in the Armed Forces of the United Nations.  Here comes the Bandwagon." </u>
<br><br><b>MUSIC</b> -- DUKE'S THEME [<i>Take the A Train</i> plays for 24 seconds over applause.]

<br><br>(APPLAUSE)<br><br>AUDIENCE APPLAUSE FADES ON CUE FOR

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br><u>Ah yes,</u> the one and only Duke Ellington and his orchestra. <u>You know,</u> it's the first time the old Bandwagon has caught up with the Duke in person, but <u>believe me,</u> he's been with us in spirit ever since we first started rolling. <br><br>Yes, Duke your compositions have made up a large portion of the Bandwagon's cargo ever since we first hit the air lanes.

<br><br><b>Duke:</b><br>That sure is mighty nice to hear, and I only hope we can play other people's music as well as you've presented ours.

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br>I'm sure I wouldn't lose any sleep worrying over that, and I'm sure the composer of "Canteen Bounce" feels the same <u>way</u> as Duke Ellington and the boys get under way. <br><br><u>And</u> here it is, <s>the</s> <u>Duke Ellington, the orchestra and</u>  "Canteen Bounce".

<br><br><b>MUSIC</b> -- CANTEEN BOUNCE

<br><br>(APPLAUSE)
<s>
<br><br><b>Announcer:</b> (Commercial) (4:30)

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br> Jack we've really had a number of especially nice, sunshiny days lately.

<br><br>Jack:<br> Yes, Tobe - and with the girls going hatless, they want the summer sunshine to help bring out the natural highlights in their hair. They want their hair to be sparkling and radiant. That means Fitch Shampoo -- yes, Fitch Shampoo doesn't leave soap film and curd deposits which make the hair dull and drab. Furthermore - Fitch Shampoo is the ONLY Shampoo made whose guarantee to remove dandruff with the first application bears the backing of one of the world's largest insurance firms. The reason Fitch Shampoo makes all this difference is because IT IS so different. even applied differently. Fitch's applied to the hair and scalp before a drop of water is added. Undiluted Fitch Shampoo penetrates the tiny hair openings, dissolving dandruff. Then - in the rich creamy lather that works up with the addition of soft or hard water - all those accumulations of dust, dirt and dandruff are carried off. So - after a Fitch Shampoo, the hair is antiseptically clean. It's full of life. and sparkle. and luster. For beautiful hair, everyone should have a regular weekly Fitch Shampoo. So - at your barber or beauty shop, ask for a professional Fitch application - or, buy a bottle of Fitch Shampoo, spelled f i t c h - Fitch Shampoo - at your drug counter. (5:

<br><br>Hand-written note:<br> Orch: <i>Things</i> (5:50-6:20)<br>[ Carl H&auml;llstr&ouml;m's note: - the tune played is actually <i>PERDIDO!</i> ]<br><br>[DETS plays Perdido, with no preceding announcement, fading to]

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br> I wonder how many of you passengers would applaud if someone stepped out on a stage and announced Edward Kennedy Ellington? <s>However,</s> <u>Now</u> I'm sure the house would come down if you heard Duke Ellington announced, and yet <u>believe it or not</u> they're one and the same.

<br><br><b>Duke:</b><br>Sometimes I wonder! You know it seems to be I've never been anything else than Duke. I hardly know the other name myself.

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br>I understand you've had the name Duke since you were <u>well</u> about twelve years old.

<br><br><b>Duke:</b><br>That's right. A publicity man once tried to tie it up with my taste in clothes, but you know that a kid of twelve doesn't go around looking like a Duke.

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br><u>Well</u> I suppose you are <u>you're</u> right <u>there, Duke</u>. However, it could be the reason today <u>that</u> as I've never seen you when you weren't immaculate, and dressed in perfect taste. <u>But then </u> let's stick to those early days for a while Duke <s>and</s> Tell me how <s>you got</s> <u>did you get</u> into music.<u>?</u>

<br><br><b>Duke:</b><br><u>Well,</u> I don't think I got into music at all. I think Music got into me. My first intention was to go to Art School and study Fine Arts.

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br><u>Well,</u> for my money what you're doing today is <s>a</s> <u>mighty</u> "fine art". But what happened to change you over?

<br><br><b>Duke:</b><br>Well, when I was in High School I worked as a soda jerker in a place where they had a pianist. When the pianist was off, I got to fooling around on the piano. (7:25)

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br><u>Now wait a minute, Duke,</u> <s>And </s> do you mean to say that your brand of piano playing is the result of "fooling around" as you call it? Didn't you take any lessons?

<br><br><b>Duke:</b><br><u>Well I had a little elementary piano and harmony but I was afraid to go too far with the conservatory training</u> <s>No, you see I felt that lessons</s> <u>for fear I</u> might spoil whatever I had that was original. I <s>felt</s> <u>feel</u> that way about an art student who spends hours copying old masters. They're apt to become just imitators.

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br><u>Well,</u> your compositions have certainly justified your viewpoint<s>s</s> <u>Duke</u> so <s>I wouldn't </s> <u>I'm not going to</u> try to argue with you. But you know we can't spend too much time talking about music when we've got you here to do something about it <u>for us</u> so I'd like to hear more about your early days after we've heard Betty Roch&eacute; in your arrangement of "Hay Foot Straw Foot". (8:00)

<br><br><b>MUSIC</b> -- HAY FOOT STRAW FOOT (9:50)

<br><br>(APPLAUSE) (10:00)

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br><u>[Inaudible comment] I can see they liked that, Duke.</u><br><br>We can't go much further in a program featuring Duke Ellington without having the Duke play one of his own tunes. <u>You know,</u> after such hits as "<i>Mood Indigo</i>", [well] "<i>It Don't Mean A Thing If You Ain't Got That Swing</i>", "<i>Sophisticated Lady</i>", "<i>Solitude</i>" and "<i>I Let A Song Go Out Of My Heart</i>".<u> I could go on here all night this way.  Anyway we've</u> <s>well you </s> come to expect hits every time a tune appears with Duke Ellington's name on it, and not only do <s>you</s> <u>we</u> expect it,  <s>you</s> <u>believe me, we really</u> get it.<br><br><u>So</u> here's the tune that's sweeping the country today, played by the composer with his own orchestra. Duke Ellington's <s>smash hit...</s> "Don't Get Around Much Anymore". (10:25)

<br><br><b>MUSIC</b> -- DON'T GET AROUND MUCH ANYMORE (12:10)

<br><br>(APPLAUSE) (13:35)

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br><u>[inaudible] - had the music of the Duke with Johnny Hodges featured with the saxophone and Don't Get Around Anymore. <br><br>You know,</u> I'd like to hear more of the early days when Duke Ellington was just <u>sorta</u> "fooling around" on the piano as he calls it. What else were you doing then Duke?

<br><br><b>Duke:</b><br><u>Well,</u> like I told you, I had art on the mind. After High School, I won a scholarship to Pratt Inst<u>itute</u>. To study art, but the nearest I came to it was painting signs, and there again, I ran smack into music.

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br><u>Now, wait, wait a minute, pull over.</u> <s>Just</s> How did sign painting and music get together?

<br><br><b>Duke:</b><br><u>Well,</u> when an organization came to me to paint a sign advertising their dance. <u>Well,</u> I, I can make you, I can make you...<u>Well,</u> You can make your own guess [giggling] <s> who's name I printed in on the sign.</s>

<blockquote>[ <i>Carl A. H&auml;llstr&ouml;m's note:<br>
On the actual broadcast, Duke is very much "lost" at the beginning of the discussion of him painting a sign advertising a dance and the joke of the story is never delivered. Bandwagon Driver Tobe Reed finally rescues Duke by saying: "I know what you mean!"</i> ]</blockquote>

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br><u>I see exactly what you mean, Duke. You know, speaking of signs and that sort of thing, and this has nothing to do with it, but</u> <s> I bet you learned to print "Duke Ellington" in all sorts of styles. Then did you go from sign painting into professional orchestra leading?

<br><br><b>Duke:</b><br>There were a few other side tracks, and one of them was very valuable. I was born in Washington, D.C. and I worked for a time as Transportation Clerk in the War and Navy Department Buildings. Man, I got so I could tell you time tables by memory, and how to get to any part of the country.

<br><br><b>Toby:</b><br> I can see how that was valuable, with the road tours you've taken since with the orchestra. You know Duke, the Bandwagon is doing the same for me, with the way we get around.<br><br>Speaking of getting around the country, I hear </s> your son is getting around the country a bit for Uncle Sam these days<u>,isn't he?</u>

<br><br><b>Duke:</b><br>That's right, and I'm mighty proud of Mercer <u>too</u>. He was at Camp Dix for a while, and now he's at Camp Croft in South Carolina. (15:40)

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br><u>Well,</u> I <s>also</s> understand that until he became Private Mercer Ellington, he was following in his <s>father's</s> <u>pappy's</u> footsteps. <u>How about that?</u>

<br><br><b>Duke:</b><br>Following, but not too closely. I guess Mercer feels about <s>the</s> music as I <s>do</s> <u>did</u>. He wouldn't let me teach him, and maybe it's better. He studied at Julliard Institute and with some very good private tutors <u>too</u>. How would you like to hear one of his songs?

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br><s>If you don't mind being called a "block",</s> <u>Well Duke</u> I'd say that <u>he's</u> a chip off the old block, <u>and that's good enough for the Bandwagon, especially</u> when <s> the </s><u>that</u> old block is Duke Ellington<s>, would be perfect material for the Bandwagon</s>.

<br><br><b>Duke:</b><br>  If you don't mind, I'd like to dedicate it to Mercer and all his Buddies, because it's a tune with a mighty good thought. He calls it "A Slip Of The Lip Might Sink A Ship."

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br>Sounder advice was never set to music, Duke. Let's hear Mercer Ellington's tune with Ray Nance doing the vocal honors. "A Slip Of The Lip Might Sink A Ship." (16:25)

<br><br><b>MUSIC</b> -- A SLIP OF THE LIP MIGHT SINK A SHIP (18:45)
<br><br>(APPLAUSE)

<s>
<br><br><b>Announcer:</b><br> COMMERCIAL (18:55)

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br>Jack, you've been eyeing the microphone as if you couldn't wait to tear it away from me.

<br><br><b>Jack:</b><br> Truthfully, Tobe - that's how I feel. So many men have switched to Fitch No-Brush Shaving Cream that I just want to get up and tell the reasons why. You know - soon there are going to be a lot of new, sore sunburned faces. Faces that will cringe at the thought of shaving. But with the switch to Fitch's No-Brush - these sensitive sunburned faces will feel the benefits of the special "skin conditions." For - actually - men - this wonderful "skin conditions" in Fitch No-Brush prepares the tenderest, most sensitive face for a cool, relaxing shave. That's point one! Then, point two - there are special shaving properties in Fitch No-Brush which make for a closer, easier shave even against the grain of the beard. And - point three - right in this one easy-to-use shaving cream are contained all the ingredients of your after-shaving lotions. No more setting out several different shaving preparations, no more jar juggling. Remember - this one great shaving cream supplies all three needs. Remember, too - Fitch's No-Brush is designed especially for sensitive skins. even sensitive skins with tough beards. Fitch's Lather type also contains this same wonderful "skin conditions." At your drug counter, ask for Fitch's No-Brush or Lather Type Shaving Cream. in handy glass jars - 25 and 50 cents. (19:00)</s>

<br><br><b>MUSIC</b> -- THING'S AIN'T WHAT THEY USED TO BE (19:40)

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br>[over music: <u>You know, passengers,</u> There are few men who in their own lifetime are lucky enough to receive recognition and acclaim for their efforts when they have held to ideas that were very new and <u>very</u> radical. Our guest Duke Ellington is one of these lucky few. Duke came to New York in 1923 with a brand of music that no one had heard before, and five <u>mighty good</u> musicians to play it.
<br><br><b>Duke:</b><br><u>Well,</u> I couldn't have done it if those <s>five</s> <u>boys</u> hadn't had faith in what we were doing too. Three of <u>the</u> five are still with me.

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br>And how the band has grown <u>up</u> since then! First came the old Cotton Club in Harlem, then Flo Ziegfeld featured them in "Show Girl" <u>and,</u> then came the European tours didn't they, Duke?

<br><br><b>Duke:</b><br>That's right. One in 1933 and another <s>one</s> in 1939. During the last one we played 31 cities in 32 days in Sweden.

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br>All I can say is that it's a far yodel from the little boy who was a soda jerker <u>down</u> in Washington, D.C. <u>and I can bring that up to date by touching lightly on the</u> <s>Then in the early part of this year, came</s> the concert in Carnegie Hall <u>early this year</u>  where <s>he</s> <u>the Duke</u> received a plaque signed by Stokowski, Rodzinski, <s>and</s> Damrosch <u>and many</u> <s>among </s> others. That was when <s>you</s> <u>he</u> presented <s>your</s> <u>his</u> Musical Parallel to the history of the Negro race titled "Black, Brown and Beige," <s>wasn't it,</s> <u>right,</u> Duke?

<br><br><b>Duke:</b><br>Yes, that's right. I hope to soon have a book out with the same title, which will further explain the music.

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br><u>Well, we'll be looking forward to that book, believe me,</u> <s>That's something I'll look forward to,</s> but right now I'm looking forward to some <u>of that might good</u> music. <u>you know</u> Ever since you were announced for this program Duke,  <s>I've</s><u> the old mailbag has</u> been swamped by requests for <u>just</u> one thing. (21:05)

<br><br><b>Duke</b><br><u>I sure do,</u> [inaudible] sure do my best to help you out.

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br>Well, it seems all your old fans want something out of the old days when you first began to attract attention <s>at</s> <u>out of</u> the Cotton Club. One of those numbers that started all <u>the</u> other band leaders taking notice of <s>a</s> <u>that</u>new type of music.

<br><br><b>Duke:</b><br>  Well, there's one tune that I think is typical of those days. It might be a bit dusty, but perhaps we can polish <u>it</u> off <s>the</s> <u>ehh, an</u> old arrangement of "Ring Dem Bells".

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br><s>I'd say that's perfect</s> <u>[inaudible] [applause] and there's your answer</u> Duke, and from the responses I observe here in the studio, <u>folks,</u> I'd say you picked the perfect tune <u>Duke</u>. <s>Here is </s>Duke Ellington <s>and his</s> <u>the</u> Orchestra <s>in one of his early favorites. </s> <u>and</u> "Ring Dem Bells." (21:35) <br>

<br><br><b>MUSIC</b> -- RING DEM BELLS (25:20)<br>

<br><br>(APPLAUSE)

<br><br><b>Tobe:</b><br>And that puts a very solid tag on a visit with one of the country's most famous orchestra leaders and composers. Duke Ellington. So now as the Duke heads back to the Hurricane Restaurant where he's currently appearing, we head the old Bandwagon out to Cleveland for a visit with one of our old regulars. Horace Heidt and his Musical Knights, and with Horace on board, you can be sure of an entertaining ride. Well passengers, Alex Dreier will take over the Bandwagon in a moment to bring you the very latest in World News, so this is your Bandwagon Driver Tobe Reed, saying a good buy is United States War Saving Bond..
